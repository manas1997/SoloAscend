I want to build a full-stack motivational productivity app called **SoloAscend** — inspired by the Solo Leveling system — that guides me to become a billionaire by the end of 2025.

Use:

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS (responsive + dark mode)
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, database, storage)
- **Deployment**: Replit + Supabase
- **Motivation Engine**: Use quotes and character voices from Solo Leveling
- **AI Assistant**: Local logic module (NOT Rork) that suggests daily missions based on my energy, mood, and available time

---

📦 App Modules (Organize code by folders):

1. **Auth Module**  
   - Supabase Auth for login/sign-up  
   - Protect routes for authenticated users  
   - Show onboarding on first login

2. **Mission Engine**  
   - Store and fetch daily tasks from Supabase `missions` table  
   - Allow users to complete, skip, or delay missions  
   - Track task duration and mood logs

3. **SoloAscend Assistant Module (No Rork)**  
   - Input: time_available, energy_level (1–5), mood ("focused", "drained", "motivated")  
   - Output: fetch suitable missions from Supabase based on logic like:  
     ```
     if (energy >= 4 && mood === 'focused') => hard tasks  
     if (energy <= 2 || mood === 'drained') => easy tasks  
     ```
   - Use Supabase filters (`time_required <= input`, `difficulty`, etc.)  
   - Fallback to default missions if no match  
   - Handle errors/failures cleanly and show user-friendly messages

4. **Progress Tracker**  
   - Log completions in Supabase `progress` table  
   - Show streaks, history, and graphs  
   - Use local cache if offline, sync later

5. **Motivation Engine**  
   - Show random quotes from Supabase `quotes` table  
   - Play `.mp3` audio from Supabase Storage linked to quotes  
   - Schedule daily motivational triggers

6. **Project Arena**  
   - Manage long-term goals (CareerCopilot, Kids AI) as sub-projects  
   - Allow tracking subtasks and deadlines  
   - Sync with the mission engine

7. **Settings Module**  
   - Configure quote frequency, voice volume, system goals  
   - Store preferences in Supabase `user_settings`

---

🛠️ Technical Notes:

- Use `.env` for Supabase keys — do not hardcode  
- Use modular React components, not monolithic files  
- Apply loading states, error boundaries, and fallback content  
- Make UI minimalist and themed around Solo Leveling (dark, aura, animated loading)

📁 Supabase Tables Required:
- `missions(id, title, category, difficulty, time_required, project_id, description)`
- `progress(user_id, mission_id, date, status, mood, energy_level)`
- `quotes(id, text, character, audio_url)`
- `user_settings(user_id, quote_frequency, voice_volume, preferred_focus_hours)`
- `projects(id, name, description, start_date, end_date)`

---

✅ Deliverables:
- A working React app with Supabase backend  
- Modular folder structure  
- Authenticated mission generation logic based on local rules  
- Audio + motivational quote integration  
- Project goal tracker  
- Error-handled, production-ready frontend/backend code  
- Optional: Dummy seed data

Let me know if you want test audio files or sample quote data next.
