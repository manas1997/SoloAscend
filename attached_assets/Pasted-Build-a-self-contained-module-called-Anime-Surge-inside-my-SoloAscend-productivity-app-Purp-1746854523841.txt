Build a self-contained module called **Anime Surge** inside my SoloAscend productivity app.

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Show short anime-themed motivational reels with music and quotes from public Instagram accounts (no login required) to boost motivation when user taps "Need Motivation."

ðŸ“Œ Requirements:

1. **Tech Stack**  
   - You choose the most suitable and modern stack (frontend + backend + DB + storage)  
   - Must run in Replit smoothly  
   - Use built-in tools like Supabase, Firebase, or Replit DB for storage  
   - Auto-deploy and test the whole module to ensure it's error-free and fully functional

2. **Core Features**  
   - A page or component called `AnimeSurge`
   - On page load: fetch all anime reels (video + thumbnail + quote)
   - Each reel has:
     - Video autoplay
     - Motivational quote text overlay
     - Character name (e.g. Gojo, Sung Jin-Woo)
     - Source Instagram handle (must be public)
   - "Need Motivation" button â†’ randomly open one reel in full screen
   - Reels can loop and should be optimized for mobile and desktop

3. **Backend & Storage**
   - Create a DB/table called `anime_reels` with the following fields:
     - `video_url`, `thumbnail_url`, `quote`, `character`, `source_account`, `date_added`
   - Store videos in a CDN or storage service (your choice)
   - Allow safe upload via form (admin side optional)

4. **Visuals & Style**
   - Dark theme with glowing, neon Solo Leveling-style UI
   - Add smooth transitions and motivational vibe

5. **Stability**
   - Handle loading/error states gracefully
   - Validate all data and links
   - Ensure all Supabase/DB/storage queries are clean, efficient, and fail-safe
   - Add error logging and loading UI states

6. **Testing**
   - Test the module thoroughly for bugs
   - Automatically validate that:
     - Videos load and play
     - Quotes render
     - Random full-screen modal works
     - DB fetches successfully
   - Resolve and highlight any errors before showing final output

Deploy the **Anime Surge** module as part of my existing SoloAscend project. Output tested and running code.
